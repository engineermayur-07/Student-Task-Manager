# 📚 Student Task Manager

## 🎯 Project Goal
The Student Task Manager is a simple web application designed to help students organize their academic life by tracking daily tasks, accessing useful resources, and viewing their schedule.

This project is built using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and serves as a **proof-of-concept for the frontend structure** before integrating a persistent backend.

## ✨ Features

### Current Working Features (Frontend)
* **Guest Access:** Users can bypass the login form and continue directly to the main dashboard using the "Continue as Guest" option.
* **Navigation Tabs:** A clean and easy-to-use interface featuring four main tabs on the homepage:
    * **Tasks:** A dedicated area to input and view current academic tasks.
    * **Resources:** A curated list of external links (videos, study notes, websites, etc.) relevant to student success.
    * **Timetable:** (Future implementation area for class schedules).
    * **About:** Information about the application.
* **Temporary Task Storage:** Tasks entered in the "Tasks" tab are temporarily displayed using **vanilla JavaScript** and remain visible until the page is refreshed.
* **Clean Design:** Implementation uses clean, maintainable CSS for a simple and modern user experience.

## 🚧 Current Limitations & Future Scope

This project is currently in the initial **Frontend Development Phase**. Several key features are intentionally deferred for the next development cycle:

| Feature | Current Status | Next Plan |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Login Validation** | **Non-functional.** The form is present for structure but does not validate user input or authenticate. | Implement robust client-side and server-side authentication and validation. |
| **Data Persistence** | **Temporary.** Tasks are lost upon page refresh (stored only in memory). | Integrate a server-side backend (e.g., Node.js, Python, or Firebase) and a database (SQL or NoSQL) to permanently save tasks and user data. |
| **Timetable** | Placeholder tab. | Develop functionality to allow users to input and display their class schedules. |
